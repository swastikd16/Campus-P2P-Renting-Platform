# 📦 Campus Peer-to-Peer Renting Platform

A campus-exclusive platform where students can **lend and borrow items from each other securely for a small fee**. Items like scientific calculators, formal shoes, lab coats, pumps, books, cables, and sports equipment can be rented instead of purchased — saving money, time, and reducing resource wastage on campus.

---

## 💡 Why This Platform?
Students frequently need temporary items but end up:
- Buying them unnecessarily
- Searching for them at the last moment
- Borrowing without any guarantee of return

Meanwhile, many students already own the same items but rarely use them.

This platform connects both sides and makes **resource sharing easier, safer, and beneficial for everyone**.
